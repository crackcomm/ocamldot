	OCamldot installation


*** What you need ***
- OCaml 4.12 or more installed
- lablgtk3 installed with findlib
- make ;-)

- dot version 2.2.1 or above to use the rendering

*** How to compile ***
- ./configure
- make all
- make install
- make doc    to create documentation in ocamldoc/

This will install the libraries with findlib, as "dot" package
(and "dot.gtk" if in the regular OCaml library directory).

- make test
  will create a test.x executable which parses and prints the dot
  file given on its command line.
